# Window Management & Screen Position Persistence

## Table of Contents

## Overview

The ryoe application includes advanced window management features that automatically save and restore window position, size, and state across application restarts. This provides a seamless user experience by remembering where you positioned your application window.

## Features

### Screen Position Persistence

The application automatically saves:

- **Window Position**: X and Y coordinates on screen
- **Window Size**: Width and height dimensions
- **Window State**: Maximized, minimized, or normal state
- **Multi-Monitor Support**: Handles multiple display configurations

### Automatic State Management

- **Save on Change**: Window state is saved automatically when moved or resized
- **Restore on Launch**: Previous window state is restored when the app starts
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Uses default dimensions if saved state is invalid

## Implementation

### Tauri Plugin Integration

The feature is implemented using the official `tauri-plugin-window-state` plugin:

```rust
// src-tauri/src/main.rs
use tauri_plugin_window_state;

fn main() {
    tauri::Builder::default()
        .plugin(tauri_plugin_window_state::Builder::default().build())
        // ... other plugins
        .run(tauri::generate_context!())
        .expect("error while running tauri application");
}
```

### Dependency Configuration

```toml
# src-tauri/Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
tauri-plugin-window-state = { git = "https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace", branch = "v1" }
```

### Default Window Configuration

```json
// src-tauri/tauri.conf.json
{
    "app": {
        "windows": [
            {
                "title": "ryoe",
                "width": 1000,
                "height": 600,
                "dragDropEnabled": false
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Storage Details

### File Location

Window state is stored in the application data directory:

```bash
~/.local/share/com.remcostoeten.ryoe/config/window-state.dat
```

### Data Format

The plugin stores window state in a binary format that includes:

- Window position (x, y coordinates)
- Window dimensions (width, height)
- Window state flags (maximized, minimized, etc.)
- Display information for multi-monitor setups

## Usage Examples

### Programmatic Window Control

While the plugin handles automatic persistence, you can also control windows programmatically:

```typescript
import { getCurrentWindow } from '@tauri-apps/api/window'

// Get current window instance
const appWindow = getCurrentWindow()

// Manually save current state
await appWindow.emit('tauri://save-window-state')

// Get window position
const position = await appWindow.outerPosition()
console.log(`Window at: ${position.x}, ${position.y}`)

// Get window size
const size = await appWindow.outerSize()
console.log(`Window size: ${size.width}x${size.height}`)
```

### Window State Events

Listen for window state changes:

```typescript
import { getCurrentWindow } from '@tauri-apps/api/window'

const appWindow = getCurrentWindow()

// Listen for window move events
await appWindow.listen('tauri://move', (event) => {
    console.log('Window moved:', event.payload)
})

// Listen for window resize events
await appWindow.listen('tauri://resize', (event) => {
    console.log('Window resized:', event.payload)
})
```

## Benefits

### User Experience

- **Consistent Layout**: Window appears in the same location every time
- **Multi-Monitor Friendly**: Remembers which monitor the app was on
- **No Manual Repositioning**: Saves time by eliminating need to reposition windows

### Development Benefits

- **Zero Configuration**: Works automatically without additional setup
- **Cross-Platform**: Consistent behavior across Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Reliable Storage**: Uses platform-native storage mechanisms

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Window Appears Off-Screen

If the saved position is invalid (e.g., monitor was disconnected):

- The plugin automatically detects this and uses default position
- Window will appear in the center of the primary monitor

#### State Not Persisting

Check that the application has write permissions to:

```bash
~/.local/share/com.remcostoeten.ryoe/config/
```

#### Multiple Instances

Each window instance maintains its own state. If you have multiple windows, each will remember its individual position and size.

### Debug Information

Enable debug logging to see window state operations:

```rust
// In development, add logging
#[cfg(debug_assertions)]
println!("Window state saved/restored");
```

## Environment Compatibility

### Desktop Only Feature

Window position persistence is only available in the Tauri desktop environment:

```typescript
import { isTauriEnvironment } from '@/utilities/environment'

if (isTauriEnvironment()) {
    // Window management features available
    console.log('Window state persistence enabled')
} else {
    // Web environment - feature not available
    console.log('Running in web mode - window persistence disabled')
}
```

### Graceful Degradation

The application handles the absence of this feature gracefully in web environments, ensuring consistent functionality across platforms.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for window management:

- **Custom Window Profiles**: Save different window configurations for different workflows
- **Workspace Management**: Remember window layouts for multi-window setups
- **Display Preference**: Remember preferred monitor for multi-display setups
- **Window Snapping**: Integration with OS window snapping features
