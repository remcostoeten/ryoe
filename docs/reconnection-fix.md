# Reconnection Issues Fix

## Problem

The application was showing persistent "reconnecting" messages in the browser, which was caused by:

1. **HMR (Hot Module Replacement) connection issues** - Vite's development server was having trouble maintaining WebSocket connections
2. **Port conflicts** - Multiple development servers trying to use the same ports
3. **Verbose error logging** - HMR connection attempts were being logged as errors

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced HMR Configuration**

**File: `vite.config.ts`**

```typescript
server: {
    port: 1420,
    strictPort: true,
    hmr: {
        port: 1421,
        overlay: false, // Disable error overlay to prevent reconnection messages
    },
    watch: {
        ignored: ['**/src-tauri/**']
    }
},
```

### 2. **Development Server Utilities**

**File: `src/lib/dev-server.ts`**

- Created utilities to handle HMR errors gracefully
- Added connection status indicator for development
- Filtered out noisy HMR reconnection messages
- Enhanced WebSocket error handling

### 3. **Improved Error Handling**

**File: `src/main.tsx`**

```typescript
// Setup development server utilities
if (import.meta.env.DEV) {
    setupHMRErrorHandling()
    showConnectionStatus()
}
```

### 4. **Environment-Specific Fixes**

- **Web Environment**: Clean HMR connections without Tauri interference
- **Desktop Environment**: Proper Tauri + Vite integration
- **Port Management**: Dedicated ports for different services

## Key Features Added

### 1. **Smart Error Filtering**

```typescript
// Filter out common HMR reconnection messages that aren't actual errors
if (
    message.includes('[vite] connecting...') ||
    message.includes('[vite] connected.') ||
    message.includes('WebSocket connection') ||
    message.includes('HMR')
) {
    console.warn('HMR:', ...args) // Show as warning, not error
    return
}
```

### 2. **Connection Status Indicator**

- Visual indicator showing connection status
- Appears only during reconnection attempts
- Auto-hides when connection is stable

### 3. **Enhanced WebSocket Handling**

- Prevents unnecessary error messages for HMR connections
- Graceful handling of connection drops
- Better user experience during development

## Testing Results

### ✅ Web Environment (http://localhost:1420)

- No more "reconnecting" spam in console
- Clean HMR updates
- Proper error filtering
- Visual connection status

### ✅ Desktop Environment (Tauri)

- Stable WebSocket connections
- No port conflicts
- Proper HMR functionality
- Database and Tauri APIs working

## Usage

### For Web Development

```bash
pnpm dev
# Opens http://localhost:1420
```

### For Desktop Development

```bash
pnpm tauri dev
# Launches Tauri app with HMR
```

### For Debugging

- Connection status indicator appears in top-right corner during development
- Console shows filtered, relevant messages only
- HMR events are properly categorized as warnings vs errors

## Benefits

1. **Clean Development Experience**: No more spam in console
2. **Better Debugging**: Actual errors are clearly visible
3. **Visual Feedback**: Connection status is visible when needed
4. **Stable Connections**: Improved WebSocket handling
5. **Environment Awareness**: Different behavior for web vs desktop

## Future Improvements

1. **Configurable Status Indicator**: Allow users to toggle the connection status display
2. **Advanced Filtering**: More sophisticated error message filtering
3. **Connection Recovery**: Automatic reconnection strategies
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Track HMR performance metrics
