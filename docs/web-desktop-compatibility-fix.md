# Web vs Desktop Environment Compatibility Fix

## Problem Summary

The application was failing to run in web browsers while working perfectly in the Tauri desktop environment. This was due to the app attempting to use Tauri-specific APIs that are only available in the desktop environment.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Tauri API Dependencies**

- The app was calling `invoke()` from `@tauri-apps/api/core` without checking environment
- Database initialization was attempting to connect to Rust backend (only available in desktop)
- Error handling was using Tauri-specific `relaunch()` function

### 2. **Missing Environment Detection**

- No proper environment detection to differentiate between web and desktop
- Tauri APIs were being called unconditionally
- Storage system had fallback logic but other components didn't

### 3. **Port Conflicts**

- Tauri configuration was hardcoded to port 1420
- Development server conflicts when running both web and desktop versions

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Created Environment Detection Utility**

**File: `src/lib/environment.ts`**

```typescript
export function isTauriEnvironment(): boolean {
    return typeof window !== 'undefined' && '__TAURI__' in window
}

export function isWebEnvironment(): boolean {
    return !isTauriEnvironment()
}

export async function safeExecuteInTauri<T>(
    tauriCallback: () => Promise<T>,
    fallbackValue: T,
    errorMessage?: string
): Promise<T> {
    if (!isTauriEnvironment()) {
        console.warn(
            errorMessage || 'Operation not available in web environment'
        )
        return fallbackValue
    }

    try {
        return await tauriCallback()
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Tauri operation failed:', error)
        return fallbackValue
    }
}
```

### 2. **Updated Database API with Environment Guards**

**File: `src/api/db/index.ts`**

- Added environment checks before calling Tauri APIs
- Graceful fallbacks for web environment
- Proper error messages for unsupported operations

### 3. **Fixed Provider Component**

**File: `src/components/provider.tsx`**

- Only initializes database in Tauri environment
- Logs appropriate messages for web environment
- Maintains theme initialization for both environments

### 4. **Updated Error Handling**

**File: `src/features/errors/app-error.tsx`**

- Uses `window.location.reload()` in web environment
- Uses `relaunch()` only in Tauri environment
- Dynamic button text based on environment

### 5. **Fixed Port Configuration**

**File: `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`**

- Changed from hardcoded port 1420 to 5173
- Updated dev command to specify port explicitly

## Testing Results

### Web Environment (http://localhost:3001)

✅ Application loads successfully
✅ No Tauri API errors in console
✅ Database operations gracefully skipped
✅ Theme system works
✅ UI components render correctly

### Desktop Environment (Tauri)

✅ Application launches successfully
✅ Database initialization works
✅ All Tauri APIs function properly
✅ Storage system uses Tauri store
✅ Full functionality available

## Key Benefits

1. **Universal Compatibility**: App now works in both web and desktop environments
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Features unavailable in web environment are handled gracefully
3. **Clear Logging**: Appropriate console messages for debugging
4. **Maintainable Code**: Centralized environment detection utility
5. **No Breaking Changes**: Desktop functionality remains unchanged

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers

1. **Always check environment** before using Tauri APIs:

    ```typescript
    import { isTauriEnvironment } from '@/lib/environment'

    if (isTauriEnvironment()) {
        // Use Tauri APIs
    } else {
        // Provide web fallback
    }
    ```

2. **Use the utility functions** for common patterns:

    ```typescript
    import { safeExecuteInTauri } from '@/lib/environment'

    const result = await safeExecuteInTauri(
        () => invoke('some_command'),
        'fallback_value',
        'Feature not available in web'
    )
    ```

### For Testing

- **Web testing**: Run `npx vite --port 3001` and open browser
- **Desktop testing**: Run `pnpm tauri dev` for full Tauri environment
- **Both environments**: Can run simultaneously on different ports

## Future Considerations

1. **Web-specific features**: Consider implementing web alternatives for desktop-only features
2. **Progressive enhancement**: Add more sophisticated fallbacks for web environment
3. **Feature detection**: Extend environment detection for specific capabilities
4. **Performance**: Monitor impact of environment checks on performance
